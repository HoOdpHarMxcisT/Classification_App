    ### How to Use the News Classifier App

    1. **Enter Your Text:**
       - In the text area provided above, type or paste the news article you want to classify.

    2. **Select Model:**
       - Choose a model from the dropdown below to classify the text.

    3. **Classify the Text:**
       - Click the "Classify" button. The app will use the selected model to analyze and classify the text.

    4. **View the Result:**
       - The classification result will be displayed on the screen, indicating the predicted category of the news article.

    In todayâ€™s digital age, efficiently managing the vast amount of news content is a significant challenge for news outlets. Our team at DataInsight Solutions has been brought on board as data science consultants to develop a sophisticated news classification system. We will use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to improve content categorization and enhance the reader experience.

    We will build an end-to-end system that includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation and deployment through a user-friendly Streamlit interface. This will ensure accurate classification of news articles, optimizing content management for the outlet and providing a more personalized experience for readers.

    The key stakeholders who will benefit from our solution are:

    - **Editorial Team:** Simplified workflows and better article organization.
    - **IT/Tech Support:** Easy integration and deployment of advanced models.
    - **Management:** Increased operational efficiency and valuable strategic insights.
    - **Readers:** More personalized and engaging news content.
